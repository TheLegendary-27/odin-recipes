        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pint of boiling water</li>
            <li>2 chicken stock cubes</li>
            <li>1 beef stock cubes</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of dried sage</li>
            <li>3 tbsp of butter</li>
            <li>3 tbsp of white flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the chicken cubes and beef cube into the boiling water. Give it a mix until dissolved</li>
            <li>Add in the dried sage. Mix.</li>
            <li>Preheat your pan.</li>
            <li>Put butter on pan. Melt it and move it around to coat pan.</li>
            <li>Once all butter is melted, put in the white flour. Stir around to combine the flour and butter to make a roux.
                Don't overcook the roux, we're looking for golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>Add in half of stock mixture into the roux. Stir well until it slightly thickens.</li>
            <li>As the mixture thickens more, gradually add the rest of the stock. Keep stirring well until desired
                consistency is achieved.
            </li>
            <li>Serve.</li>
        </ol>
